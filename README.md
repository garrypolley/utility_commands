# utility_commands

This repository has commands I use for making stuff easier for myself.

To make this use full add `~/utility_commands/bin` to your `PATH`.

* [cibot-pull][cibot-pull]: Copies command to clipboard that is used to make a pull request for CIBot.
* [git_rm_local][git_rm_local]: Removes all local branches that are safe to remove.
* [push-origin][push-origin]: Alias for `git push origin CURRENT_BRANCH`.
* [branch-commit][branch-commit]: Alias for `git commit -m "BRANCH_NAME - MESSAGE"`, where `MESSAGE` is passed as a command line string.
* [git-attempt-recovery][git-attempt-recovery]: This is an alias for an awesome command. It makes it easy to track down "lost" commits in your git repository. Useful if you've deleted something by accident and want to find it again. Alias command: `git fsck --unreachable | grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 | xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP`
* [hipchat-message][hipchat-message]: This allows you to send a message to hipchat see below for setup and example.
* [slack-message][slack-message]: Allows you to send a message to slack

## Setup

### slack-message

`slack-message` allows you to send a message to a slack channel. Hard coded
to internal c2fo slack for now.

1. The python [requests][requests-library] library. (`pip install requests`)
1. An environment variable `C2FO_SLACK_CIBOT_TOKEN`. You can generate that [here][slack-token-url]
1. Pass a message to the command: `echo "testing the cli" | slack-message`

### hipchat-message

The hipchat-message command requires the following:

1. The python [requests][requests-library] library. (`pip install requests`)
1. An environment variable `HIPCHAT_MESSAGE_TOKEN`. You can generate that [here][hipchat-token-url]
1. Pass a message to the command: `echo "testing the cli" | hipchat-message`

### cibot-pull

The `cibot-pull` command will work based on the teams in the file. There are two team options. It defauls to using the first team. Also, you can sepcify a branch.

* `cibot-pull` -- does the pull against develop with the default team
* `cibot-pull BRANCH` -- does the branch with default team
* `cibot-pull BRANCH whole_team` does the branch with all the teams on the PR
* `cibot-pull BRANCH devops` -- does the branch with devops team

Teams that can be used:

* `team`
* `app_team` -- `tpf_team` and `team`
* `devops`
* `whole_team` -- does all the defined teams together

Right now the room is hardcoded to where I want to post my automated messages. If you work at C2FO this may
work well for you too.

Command I actually use:

`cibot-pull | hipchat-message`

Or

`cibot-pull | slack-message`
